Online Retail Data Mining & Analytics Project
üöÄ Overview
This project showcases how advanced data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied to transactional e-commerce data to derive actionable insights. By focusing on customer segmentation, predictive analytics, and recommendation systems, this project aims to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance sales forecasting.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline
1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
Dataset: Processed the OnlineRetail.xlsx file to analyze transactional records.
Key Steps:
Handled missing values (e.g., CustomerID, Description).
Removed duplicates and detected outliers.
Created new features like TotalPrice = Quantity √ó UnitPrice.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted detailed EDA to uncover patterns in spending, returns, and customer distribution.
Visualized trends using histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
Identified outliers and anomalies for further refinement.
3. RFM Metrics & Customer Segmentation
RFM Analysis:
Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for customer insights.
Derived additional metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and LoyaltyScore.
Clustering: Applied KMeans for customer segmentation, including high-value outliers.
4. Recommendation Systems
Content-Based Filtering: Developed a TF-IDF cosine similarity model for product recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering: Built a user-based system to provide personalized product suggestions.
5. Predictive Modeling
Implemented machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) to predict average spending (AvgOrderValue).
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and evaluated models using RMSE and feature importance.
6. Time-Series Forecasting
Prophet Model:
Aggregated invoices into daily sales data.
Forecasted future trends and seasonality for sales using Prophet.
üìà Insights & Applications
Customer Segmentation:
Identified VIP customers for targeted campaigns.
Improved product descriptions and policies for high-return customers.
Sales Trends:
Discovered seasonal trends to optimize inventory and budget planning.
Forecasted future sales for strategic decision-making.
Recommendations:
Boosted cross-selling and up-selling opportunities with personalized suggestions.
Enhanced customer satisfaction by recommending relevant products.
üìÇ Repository Structure

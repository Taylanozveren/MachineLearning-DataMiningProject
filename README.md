Online Retail Data Mining & Analytics Project
üöÄ Overview
This project explores an Online Retail dataset with transactional records from an e-commerce business. The primary goal is to leverage data mining and machine learning techniques to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and forecast future sales.

Using a combination of RFM metrics, customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and time-series forecasting, this repository provides a comprehensive pipeline to turn raw data into meaningful business strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline
1. Data Import & Cleaning
Load the dataset (OnlineRetail.xlsx) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values (CustomerID and Description), remove duplicates, and detect outliers.
Compute TotalPrice = Quantity √ó UnitPrice.
Visual Example: Outlier Detection

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize metrics like spending patterns by Country, CustomerID, and InvoiceNo.
Identify and separate returns (negative Quantity or Price) to compute ReturnRate and ReturnCount.
Visualize distributions with histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to detect anomalies.
Visual Example: Correlation Matrix Heatmap

3. RFM Metrics & Feature Engineering
Recency: Days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Number of unique transactions.
Monetary: Total spending per customer.
Additional Metrics:
Average Order Value (AvgOrderValue).
Approximate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using a discount factor.
LoyaltyScore: Combines frequency and return rate for customer loyalty insights.

4. Customer Segmentation
Cluster customers using KMeans on PCA-reduced features (e.g., Recency, Frequency, CLV).
Manually assign high-value outliers (e.g., VIP customers) to a separate cluster.
Visualize clusters with PCA scatterplots and analyze their behavior.
Visual Example: Customer Segmentation with KMeans

5. Recommendation Systems
Collaborative Filtering: Suggest products based on customer similarity (user-user).
Content-Based Filtering: Recommend similar products using metadata (Price, Popularity, Category, Brand).
Output: Personalized product suggestions for customers and related item recommendations.
Visual Example: Collaborative Recommendations

6. Predictive Modeling
Build a GradientBoostingRegressor to predict AvgOrderValue using features like Recency, Frequency, and CLV.
Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and compare with baseline models (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.).
Evaluate performance with metrics like RMSE and feature importance.
Visual Example: RMSE and Feature Importance

7. Time-Series Forecasting (Prophet)
Aggregate invoices into daily sales data (TotalPrice).
Use Prophet to:
Forecast future sales and trends (next 6 months).
Evaluate the forecast on recent data with RMSE.
Incorporate seasonality and holiday effects into predictions.
